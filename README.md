For the proper functioning of the program, the user needs to ensure that the following are installed on their computer:
1. FFmpeg: It is required for video conversion. Make sure FFmpeg is installed on the system and accessible from the system path (added to PATH).
2. Python and necessary libraries: The user must have Python installed on their system. Additionally, the program uses some additional Python libraries such as tkinter, PIL, and subprocess.
If the user does not have FFmpeg installed or it is not accessible from the system path, they might encounter errors during video conversion. In such a case, they need to install FFmpeg and ensure that the path is configured correctly.
Fortunately, Python and many of the libraries used are easily available and can be installed via tools like pip. However, FFmpeg might require a separate installation procedure.
